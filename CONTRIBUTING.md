# Contributing to Neo4j Automatic Load Tester
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We develop with Github
We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through pull requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`.
2. If you've changed options, update the documentation.
3. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/michaelweidmann/automated-neo4j-load-tester/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report which is not a bad model. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408), an app developer.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
